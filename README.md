# Burger-builder
Burger-builder is a project using React/Redux with firebase and authentication. It allows users to order a burger, which will show the topics being added visually as well as the current price based on what toppings have been added and a checkout form.

When you first land on the main page, you have the option of customizing a burger and get a visual image of it. However, you must be signed up and logged in in order to order the burger. You can sign up by clicking the button "Sign up to order" or by clicking the "Authenticate" button in the top right of the page.
